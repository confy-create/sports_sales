### Business Problems
E-Stars retail is a chain of department stores that sells a wide range of products, including bikes and different components. The company is trying to identify increase sales in recent years. The management team is looking to use data analysis to understand customer spending patterns and make changes to their sales and marketing strategies to improve performance.

The company collected data on customer demographics, purchasing history, and other relevant information over the course of a year. The data includes information on the products purchased, the price paid, and the date of purchase, etc.

Iâ€™ll be using the provided dataset to understand customer spending patterns and make changes to their sales and marketing strategies to improve performance.

There are four key business questions:
1. Revenue by distribution: the requirement here is to analyze which countries and states generate the most revenue for bike racks sales.
2. Product age appeal: to check which age group patronizes the most.
3. Product Popularity: to assess how different models of bike racks perform in terms of sales volume.
4. Sales seasonality: to identify trends in bike racks sales across different times of the year and correlate them with external factors like holidays or cycling season. 



### Data Sources
This dataset is an Excel file gotten from Spital Labs.

### Tools
The main analytical tool I used in carrying out this analysis was Advanced Excel techniques.


### Data Transformation
After opening the data in Excel, I did alot of transformation in Power QUery to remove columns that were not neccesary for my analysis.
I also created 4 new columns namely: profit, cost, revenue and age category as I needed these information to properly carry out my analysis.  
I had to use some advanced transformation in Power Query to clean the data, I removed some missing values while I used the statistical input method to fill in some. I filtered column by column to search for wrongly spelt words and used find and replace to correct them. 


### Analysis and Visualization
I used pivot tables to summarize my data and visualized the report in another page.
