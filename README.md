### Business Problems
E-Stars retail is a chain of department stores that sells a wide range of products, including bikes and different components. Despite having a large customer base, the company has been struggling to increase sales in recent years. The management team is looking to use data analysis to understand customer spending patterns and make changes to their sales and marketing strategies to improve performance.

The company collected data on customer demographics, purchasing history, and other relevant information over the course of a year. The data includes information on the products purchased, the price paid, and the date of purchase, etc.

Iâ€™ll be using the provided dataset to understand customer spending patterns and make changes to their sales and marketing strategies to improve performance.

There are four key business questions:
1. Revenue by distribution: the requirement here is to analyze which countries and states generate the most revenue for bike racks sales.
2. Product age appeal: to check which age group patronizes the most.
3. Product Popularity: to assess how different models of bike racks perform in terms of sales volume.
4. Sales seasonality: to identify trends in bike racks sales across different times of the year and correlate them with external factors like holidays or cycling season.
